Pomodoro Timer

This application was created using React.js, JSX, and HTML. It's purpose is to instill good study practices by using timed intervals of studying and taking a break. This app is inspired by the pomodoro texhnique which encourages people to work with the time they have instead of against it. This makes for a better, less stressful way to study or work!

The application automatically defaults to the pomodoro 25 minutes on and 5 minutes break cyle, but the user can increase or decrease these time limits through the plus and minus arrows. The timer automatically resets after each session making the transition from work to break, and vice versa, seamless.

Some future goals for this project would be updating the CSS to make the application look more refined and professional.

Enjoy!
